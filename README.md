Abstractions.io Conference Application
===============

Simple conference app made for the Abstractions.io 2016 conference. Displays the list of talks and details about them: speaker, description, room, etc.

This app is a fork of the general conference app created by Arnaus Camus (https://github.com/lynfogeek/conference-app).

## Material Design

The app tends to follow the [Material Design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) from Google.
The app supports devices running from Android 4.0+ to Android 5.0 Lollipop.

## Features

As previously said, the app is relatively simple, the goal was not to reproduce a complex application like [the Google IO app](https://github.com/google/iosched) but a very simple one, focused on the minimum tasks. (And created within a weekend)

The app contains:
 * A schedule listing
 * The session's details view
 * An option to favorite talks

And you can also:
 * Navigate to the conference site
 * Press the refresh button to look again at the VectorDrawable animations
